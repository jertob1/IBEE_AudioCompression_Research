Driven by my passion for both computer science and music, I sought to explore the interdisciplinary space where these fields intersect. This research delves into audio compression algorithms and their implications for bioacoustics, specifically in analyzing bird sounds.

The study examines the usability of MP3 (lossy) and FLAC (lossless) compression algorithms in bioacoustic research. By conducting quantitative and qualitative experiments with spectral analysis, I evaluated how these algorithms affect compression ratios and audio quality, focusing on noise levels and signal integrity. Results indicate that while FLAC retains full fidelity, MP3—when encoded at 128kbps or higher—remains viable for bioacoustic analysis without significantly degrading important frequency patterns.

This investigation underscores the balance between audio quality and file size, offering insights into the practical application of compression algorithms in biological research. The findings contribute to ongoing discussions on efficient data storage and processing in scientific fields relying on acoustic analysis.
